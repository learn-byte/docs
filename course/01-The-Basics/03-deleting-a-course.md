# Deleting a Course

### All good things must come to an end...

If you need to delete a course you can do so by visiting:

https://github.com/learn-byte/YOUR-COURSE-NAME-HERE/settings


Alternatively you can log into your account and visit:

https://www.learn-byte.com/user

Then click the red Trash Delete icon.

![delete-course](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-byte/docs/master/assets/images/delete-course.png)

Scroll all the way to the bottom of the Settings page and click `Delete this repository`

![delete-repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-byte/docs/master/assets/images/delete-repository.png)

You'll need to enter the name of the repository to confirm the deletion.

The course will be forever removed from `learn-byte.com` as soon as the repository is deleted.
