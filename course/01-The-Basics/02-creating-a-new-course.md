# Creating a New Course

### Before making a new course make sure you have created a learn-byte account and logged in successfully. 

From the user page (you can get to it by clicking Login or your username in the upper right hand corner of the website), locate the "Create a Course" sidebar.

From the user page enter a course name into the "Create Course" sidebar field.

Allow about 30 seconds for the course to create. The course will be initialized as a repository on github with some basic template content already in place to start from.

Authorize yourself as an admin collaborator on the course repository that you just created.

```
```

Accept Github's request to authorize yourself as an admin collaborator:

```
```

Once your course has been created you can View it on Github where you can then clone the course to your local computer and start building your course!
